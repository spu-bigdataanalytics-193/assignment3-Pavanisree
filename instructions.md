In this assignment, I worked on map reduce algorithm. Here we have a dataset of size 1.6 GB, with the records of nearly 120 million records. Our goal is to use map-reduce algorithm to get the count of number of flights in each carrier.
The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. Each row represents an individual flight record with details of that flight in the row.
