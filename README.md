In this assignment, I worked on map reduce algorithm. Here we have a dataset of size 1.6 GB, with the records of nearly 120 million records. Here our goal is to use map-reduce algorithm to get the count of number of flights in each carrier.
The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. Each row represents an individual flight record with details of that flight in the row. 
Using Map reduce alogirthm we have mapped number of carriers and printed them .
Using sort we have sorted all the carrier details and printed the count of each carrier
